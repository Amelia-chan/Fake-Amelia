Amelia

Amelia stands as the generic name for Amelia-chan's entire HTTP crawler. Amelia is used in only one site and crawls only
the specific areas of the site: RSS Feed, Search Engine and the User Profile. The site, ScribbleHub, will be the only site
that will be crawled by Amelia and will obey the current robots.txt implementation.

How Amelia accesses ScribbleHub

Amelia accesses ScribbleHub at either an interval time (10 minutes as of writing) or when a request for data is required
that is requested by a user at the platform, Discord. Amelia will retry HttpRequests up to ten times before failing out which
can explain an increase in requests.
